# Student Management System

A Java program that demonstrates the implementation of Generics and Collections by managing student records in a university setting. Built as part of Object-Oriented Programming (CST8284) coursework at Algonquin College.

## Project Overview

This system implements a student record management system that:
- Manages student information (name, ID, email, and grade)
- Uses Comparable interface for student grade-based sorting
- Demonstrates both array and ArrayList implementations
- Provides functionality to add, remove, and sort student records

## Features
- Student record management with core student attributes
- Grade-based sorting implementation using Comparable interface
- Dual implementation using both arrays and ArrayList
- StudentManager class for list management operations
- Custom toString() method for clear data representation

## Technical Implementation
- Generics implementation with Comparable<Student>
- ArrayList collection usage
- Array sorting using Arrays.sort()
- Collection sorting using StudentManager
- Comprehensive student data handling

## Features Demonstrated
- Implementation of compareTo() method
- Array and ArrayList handling
- Sorting implementations
- Custom toString() formatting
- Student record management methods
